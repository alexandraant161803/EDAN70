# NLP and Semantic Measures for analysing psychological constructs
Project in Computer Science - EDAN70

This repository contains code for a project in Artificial Intelligence at Lund University. 

We use natural language processing and semantic measures to examine how well a questionnaire with open-ended questions and text responses performs in relation to two categorical scales, one for depression and one for anxiety. Furthermore, we investigate if we can predict whether a person is diagnosed with depression, anxiety, both or not using their responses to the questions. 


## Setup
* Input data: Create a 'data' folder and put the 'response_format_cleaned_ds1.csv' file and the 'spaceEnglish1.csv' file there.
* Requirements: Make sure you have the packages in requirements.txt
* To run the models on the anxiety dataset: run analysis_anxiety_responses.ipynb
* To run the models on the depression dataset: run analysis_depression_responses.ipynb
